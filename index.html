I know now that every step I've taken, every choice I've made, has led me to where I am today. And this is where I was always meant to be. I'm not running away anymore. I'm not afraid of what I might lose. Because I know that when I'm with my Pokemon, I'm stronger than anything. They've given me the courage to fight for what I believe in, to make difficult choices, and to never give up, no matter how hard it gets. That's what it means to be a Pokemon Trainer."</p>
